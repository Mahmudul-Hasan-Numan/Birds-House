                <h1>Birds Tell Us That We Need To Act On Climate</h1>
                <p>Birds are telling us we are in a climate emergency and it is wreaking havoc on our communities, our
                    lands,
                    and our waters. We're living on a warming planet, with growing inequities, where natural spaces,
                    birds,
                    and
                    wildlife are disappearing at an alarming rate. The survival of some of our most beloved and familiar
                    birds,
                    including the Common Loon, Rufous Hummingbird, and Wood Thrush, is in question. Nearly every species
                    will
                    see changes to its habitat, range, and migratory patterns.

                <h1>The Surprisingly Complex Science Of Bird Longevity</h1>
                <p>
                    How long do birds live? Whether you want to ace this question at your next bird-themed trivia
                    challenge
                    or just impress someone spontaneously, here's the answer: Birds can live between four and 100 years,
                    depending on the species.

                    While it may win you trivia points, this answer may raise more questions than it resolves: Why is
                    there
                    such a range of lifespans? Which birds live the longest? Can some birds really live to be 100?

                    Answering these questions proves to be surprisingly hard. In many cases, the seemingly simple
                    question
                    of how old is that bird can be impossible to answer.

                <h2>reproductive behaviour</h2>
                <p>Reproductive behaviour in animals includes all the events and actions that are directly involved in
                    the
                    process by which an organism generates at least one replacement of itself. In an evolutionary sense,
                    the
                    goal of an individual in reproduction is not to perpetuate the population or the species; rather,
                    relative to the other members of its population, it is to maximize the representation of its own
                    genetic
                    characteristics in the next generation.</p>
